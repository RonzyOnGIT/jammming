# Jammming
Frontend website where u can look for spotify songs as well as create a playlist for your account!

### Note
Currently this has to be run in conjuction with the backend repo: https://github.com/RonzyOnGIT/jammming_backend
I plan to host the at least host the backend in the near future so you dont have to clone and run the backend repo.


run `npm i` to install dependencies then to launch app, run `npm run dev` and open a browser with the given localhost address and port

### Usage
First, you will be prompted to log in to your spotify account to provide access to your account's information like playlists and username
